#### Start Telive GUI Program

This program is written for starting Telive. For now it only start Telive for used with UDP. 
This is my first program written in QT. 
So no fancy thing is done in this program.

I hope it can help and better understand haw to use UDP with Telive. And for some people it is 
better to use GUI to start and understand thing than using old style unix commands. 

This is still just in Beta version and it must be compiled with QT Creator. 
This version is created with QT Creator 4.3.1 and based on QT 5.9.1 Open Source version.

I still have no idea haw to deploy runnning version. Still have to lean a lot.... 

Added function for switch between FIFO and UDP.
